      <description>This is the first trial post for the Unstandard Deviations blog, a site in which I aim to present some of my own musings about the world, build lessons for using R and demonstrating some of its capabilities, as well as keep track of some of the research and applied work I’ve done and my thoughts on them throughout the week. I don’t expect a large following; in fact, if I even have a single dedicated reader then this would be a success.</description>

      <description>My name is Anthony Raborn. I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Florida in Research and Evaluation Methodology. This is a blog that will discuss mostly statistical and research matters that I encounter in my life, with a little bit of worldly commentary thrown in for good measure.
The current theme for this website is an excellent minimalist theme produced by Yihui Xie, and most or all of the content is produced in R with the blogdown package serving as the lynchpin.</description>
