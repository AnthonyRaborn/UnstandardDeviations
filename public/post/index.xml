      <description>Part 1 of Reproducibility Show me the methods! One of the pet peeves I have regarding science in general is the lack of openness regarding the methods used. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about which statistical tests were used (although sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s hard to decipher from papers or talks). Rather, there seems to be a reluctance for academics to fully describe the steps they took throughout the entire research process&amp;ndash;how they acquired the sample, any power analyses ran prior to the study to inform sample size requirements, techniques used to record and store data, decisions made with regards to missingness, etc.</description>

      <title>Fun Friday: Structural Breaks Part 1</title>

      <description>This is the introductory “Fun Friday” post, and unfortunately will be a rehash of some work I’ve done in the past with a colleague (Zachary Collier, Ph.D. Candidate in my program). The topic is a concept from econometrics called “Structural Breaks”, which are also referred to as change points in some contexts. This post walks through the application of structural breaks to SAT data using the strucchange package. This example was created three years ago, so other packages for performing this analysis probably exist, but that’s left as an exercise for any interested reader.</description>

      <description>This is the first trial post for the Unstandard Deviations blog, a site in which I aim to present some of my own musings about the world, build lessons for using R and demonstrating some of its capabilities, as well as keep track of some of the research and applied work I’ve done and my thoughts on them throughout the week. I don’t expect a large following; in fact, if I even have a single dedicated reader then this would be a success.</description>
