      <description>This is the first trial post for the Unstandard Deviations blog, a site in which I aim to present some of my own musings about the world, build lessons for using R and demonstrating some of its capabilities, as well as keep track of some of the research and applied work I’ve done and my thoughts on them throughout the week. I don’t expect a large following; in fact, if I even have a single dedicated reader then this would be a success.</description>
