My name is Anthony Raborn. I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Florida in Research and Evaluation Methodology. This is a blog that will discuss mostly statistical and research matters that I encounter in my life, with a little bit of worldly commentary thrown in for good measure.

The current theme for this website is an excellent minimalist theme produced by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), and most or all of the content is produced in R with the `blogdown` package serving as the lynchpin.
