My name is Anthony Raborn. I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Florida in Research and Evaluation Methodology. This is a blog that will discuss mostly statistical and research matters that I encounter in my life, with a little bit of worldly commentary thrown in for good measure.

Most or all of the content is produced in R with the `blogdown` package serving as the lynchpin. The theme may change from time to time as I settle on a look I like, but any theme I use is the property of its original creator and I am only borrowing it with minor modifications to suit my needs.
