For this update, I'm going to talk about some of my experiences with job searching (since that is what I spent some time doing this weekend). 

For some context, my job search has been occuring in the Tampa Bay area and has been focused on jobs that involve something like "Statistician," "Data Scientist," or "Data Analyst" in the title. I used Google, which has a surprisingly decent jobs search functionality, and LinkedIn. Somewhat surprisingly to me, there weren't that many jobs available with these titles that I felt qualified for. The business world, for some reason, appears to have taken over the world of analyses: more than half of the jobs I found involved Business Analytics and had a stated preference for these degrees. This is of course frustrating for me, since I have the knowledge and skills on the *statistical* side of things to perform the job without worry, but the specific technologies they use are unfamiliar to me and my CV/Resume would probably be thrown out the door.

The plurality of the remaining jobs were more akin to engineering and were asking for computer science-related skills such as Apache Spark and Hadoop. Unfortunately for me, the education field rarely needs to utilize such technologies (education Big Data is not the same as business Big Data, it seems). These jobs I'm not so worried about missing out on.

I did apply to a handful of jobs (scientist and analyst) that I felt at least mostly qualified for, but waiting on phone calls or emails is not too exciting. Thankfully, the school district job I applied for (which is my #1 preference!) sent me a written interview, so I'm at least being considered for it. With any luck, I'll be asked for an in-person interview soon and will get a feeling for the likelihood I get an offer. My fingers are crossed for this one!
