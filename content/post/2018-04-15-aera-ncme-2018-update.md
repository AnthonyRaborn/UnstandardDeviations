I haven't posted the past two planned updates (Wednesday, Friday) due to this year's AERA/NCME conference. Wednesday was filled with my fiance and I trying to get ready for the conference, and Friday was travel since 4:00AM. Monday will probably not get an official post, either, since I have a presentation and a meeting scheduled (plus who wants to spend all their vacation time in doors? Weather permitting, we're going to be at Central Park after my responsibilies are over).

However, I have an idea for an extension of one of my NCME papers that I wanted to write down to guarantee that I remember it later. I have been working on one way to combine computer adaptive testing and multistage testing (Mca-MST), which runs counter to a previously published (and unknown to me at the time of my idea) hybridization ([Wong et al., 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jedm.12100)). Basically, my idea was to use item-level adaptation (CAT) to get better estimates of ability before administring module-level adaptation (MST), which has shown some promising results so far. However, I understand the arguments made by Wong et al., suggesting that using MST first, then CAT, would help acquire better ability estimates. 

The desire to stay within MST as much as possible, due to its perceived benefits for the examinees, has lead me to this research idea. I would like to investigate the feasibility of a test with this general framework: MST --> CAT --> MST until end. My reasoning for this idea:

1. The initial MST stage (routing) can be somewhat broad, covering a significant portion of the central mass of abilities for a given exam AND can have multiple parallel forms for increased test security.
2. After getting a moderately accurate estimate from the MST routing stage, CAT items could be administered until an arbitrary degree of precision has been reached or a certain number of items given.
3. The final MST stage(s) would then be administered and would theroetically be tailored extremely well to the individual's ability.

These stages could have varied lengths as well. Since the routing stage is the most important, allocating a larger proportion of tiems to this stage would provide a good provisional estimate, which would be further improved by the shorter second stage. Then, the third and subsequent stages (if any) could be highly focused and much shorter if necessary. 

Again, I really like the MST idea from the examinee's viewpoint. Being able to skip between items without penalty and having a bunch of (ostensibly) related items to answer at once feels better and more similar to traditional pen and paper tests. From a test construction point of view, it makes a lot of sense as well, since candidate items can be added at each stage without any trouble, content balancing and item security can be controlled directly, WITHOUT the use of complex algorithms, and the testlet format is useful in a wide variety of circumstances. Perhaps this will be what I choose to do my dissertation on? Time will tell.

Now, back to enjoying the Big Apple.
