This is the first trial post for the Unstandard Deviations blog, a site in which I aim to present some of my own musings about the world, build lessons for using R and demonstrating some of its capabilities, as well as keep track of some of the research and applied work I've done and my thoughts on them throughout the week. I don't expect a large following; in fact, if I even have a single dedicated reader then this would be a success. 

My name is Anthony Raborn, and at the time of this post I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida studying Research and Evaluation Methodology. My research interests are primarily related to Item Response Theory (IRT) models, computer adaptive testing, feature selection with IRT and structural equation models (SEM), automated model creation, and R programming. I am the creator and maintainer of the [ShortForm](www.github.com/AnthonyRaborn/ShortForm) package on CRAN and github, and another as-of-yet unpublished package that performs a mixed computer adaptive multistage test (as well as traditional multistage tests with additional formats being added over time). (For a sneak peek, click [here](www.github.com/AnthonyRaborn/caMST))

As of right now, I think I will try updating the site three days a week. Mondays, tentatively called "Mindless Mondays", are general musings about the world, with whatever I find interesting going here. The tentative "Workday Wednesdays" are about the work (either research, assistanceship, or perhaps future job) I've done throughout the past week. "Fun Fridays" are about teaching some cool tricks I've found or learned in R with examples embedded wherever possible. Hopefully this is a schedule I can keep with, but only time will tell, especially as my disseration proposal and defense loom ever-closer. 

Until next time...
